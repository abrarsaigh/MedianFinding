# Mediafind
This project displays three algorithms with different data structures, to measure and compare the speed of these algorithms in finding the median by using  Python language. It also 
 reads data from a txt file and stores it in data structures
 ** Note: The data was read through a file with a range of 50000 data.

# programming language:
python

# IDE to Start the Project
Spyder IDE Download link:
https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/releases/latest/download/Spyder_64bit_full.exe
**or you can use any editor that supports Python**

# Objective
The main goal of the project is to compare the sorting algorithms in finding the median.

# How to Open  the Project:
- Open the main folder name: ðŸ“‚(Algorithms_Project)
- Save it to your desktop. 
# This folder contains: 
1- data.txt file that we need to read in each algorithm.

2- three folders, each folder is for one Data Structure:
- Array
- Heap
- Linked
And inside each file code, There are three Algorithms

- QuickSort Algorithm

- Selection Sort

- Median finding

# Libraries:

- time
- math
- heapq
